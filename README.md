# AI-powered Resume Screening and Ranking System

## Introduction
An AI-powered resume screening and ranking system automates the process of analyzing and ranking job applicants' resumes. This system enhances recruitment efficiency by reducing manual workload, minimizing bias, and ensuring consistent evaluations.

Project Description:

This project aims to develop an intelligent system that automates the resume screening and ranking process for job applications, leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system will parse resumes, extract relevant information (skills, experience, education), and compare it against job descriptions to identify the most suitable candidates.

Resume Parsing: Utilize Python libraries (e.g., PyPDF2, docx2txt, spaCy, NLTK) to extract text from various resume formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT). Implement named entity recognition (NER) to identify key information such as names, contact details, skills, and experience.

Integration with applicant tracking systems (ATS).✔✔

Develop a scoring system that assigns scores to candidates based on their skill match, experience, and education.
